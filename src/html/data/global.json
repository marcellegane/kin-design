      "caption": "KIN stands in solidarity with our trans siblings. Fill in the GRA by 11pm!! Link in our bio •• Repost from @kwalkeronline: You should fill in the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) consultation which will only take 2 mins thanks to @levelup_uk . Currently the process for trans people to get a gender recognition certificate is long and intrusive. Making the process easier will mean many people will be able to get on with their lives with a bit more ease. With the rise in attacks in the media and IRL on our trans friends and family this is a very small thing we can do to support them in their struggle to simply exist. By responding to the GRA you are doing a small but important act to counter this rise in hate. As a cis man who is apart of varying LGBTQ communities trans people have done THE MOST for my safety and liberation. We have to push back where we can to ensure theirs cos from where I stand we are fighting the same fight. • Link in bio, you have until 11pm tonight!! Get on it  #GRA #genderrecognitionact"

      "caption": "Quobna Ottobah Cugoano was an #African abolitionist, author, philosopher and one of the first Black published activists against slavery in England. Born in 1757 in Ajumako, in what is now #Ghana, he was kidnapped at age 13 while playing near his house, and sold as a slave. He was transported to #Grenada. In his book he described the horrific working conditions in sugar plantations on the island. In 1772, he is “bought” and transported to England by Alexander Campbell. There he was baptised, manumited (“freed”) and given an English name, John Stuart, in Saint James’s church, #Picadilly. From 1784, he worked for the official painter of the royal court, Richard Cosway. With a group of other African abolitionists and intellectuals, he started the Sons of Africa. They wrote newspaper articles, petitioned the governement and wrote letters to other abolitionists. In 1787, Cugoano published a radical attack on slavery entitled Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species. The book was sent to the royal family, who stayed firmly opposed to abolition of slavery. It went through at least 3 printings in 1787, was translated into French, and Cugoano went around Britain to promote it. It was considered very radical at the time: in it Cugoano encouraged slaves to rebel and run away to become free (when most people, even in abolitionist circles, wouldn’t approve of a rebellious slave and would expect them to have a more passive and “resilient” behaviour while waiting to be saved); also, being a devout Christian, Cugoano’s arguments rely heavily on Scriptures and threaten all enslavers to eternal damnation. It is considered a philosophical and theological text, where the author’s main intent is to prove the immoral nature of slavery. Unfortunately, nothing is known of his life after that point. The only image we have of him is in this drawing by Richard Cosway, where he serves grapes to Richard and his wife. He should be remembered as one the 1st African activists in England (with an interesting perspective, as he was also a British citizen) and co-founder of one of the first African activist groups in England."

      "caption": "On Sunday January 18, 1981, a fire killed 13 young Black people, aged 15 to 21, at 439 #NewCross Road, southeast #London. They were celebrating the joint 16th birthdays of Angela Jackson and Yvonne Ruddock. Victims of the fire: Andrew Gooding, Owen Thompson, Patricia Johnson, Patrick Cummings, Steve Collins, Lloyd Hall, Humphrey Geoffrey Brown, Roseline Henry, Peter Campbell, Gerry Paul Francis, Glenton Powell, Paul Ruddock, Yvonne Ruddock - and Anthony Berbeck, survivor of the fire, who was traumatised and committed suicide 2 yrs later. Many contradictions appeared in the police investigation: they first defended the theory that the fire was the result of an attack with a fire bomb. But then the police started defending the idea of a fight between boys at the party that accidentally started the fire. Several of these men later claimed, such as Robert McKenzie in a 2001 Guardian article, that they felt like the police had their version of the events they were trying to enforce, and that they pressured the young people in telling them “what they wanted to hear”. Local community worker Ros Howells remembers the general tone of the press as criminalising and victim-blaming, implying that something illegal happened at the party. Protests took place in cities across Britain in response to the police’s behaviour in this investigation. The New Cross Massacre Action Committee was set up, and organised on March 2nd the 'Black People's Day of Action'. More than 20 000 people marched for 8 hours, from New Cross to Hyde Park. At Blackfriars Bridge, police decided to cut the march in two, which was seen as an attempt to weaken or maybe even to stop the march. The inquest into the deaths of the 13 teenagers saw criticism of the police. The victims' families challenged the procedure and while the High Court agreed that the summing-up by the coroner was inaccurate, it did not overturn the verdict. A 2nd inquest was held in 2005, which also resulted in an open verdict. In March '17, George Ruddock, a survivor of the fire, was reported in an article by @thevoicenewspaper to be gathering signatures to put pressure on Parliament for a public inquiry. #BlackBritishHistory"

      "title": "The KIN Launch | Black British Activism: Where Are We At?",
      "excerpt": "On the 5th July, the Kinfolk Network had its first official launch, an event that incorporated discussions, music, food, and good humour.",
      "content": "<p>On the 5th July, the Kinfolk Network had its first official launch, an event that incorporated discussions, music, food, and good humour. KIN, which is a bold new project aiming to unify Black British activists, organisers and campaigners across the United Kingdom was launched on the 5th July in the Archspace venue in East London. The event was only accessible to people of colour to provide a safe and comfortable environment to discuss race issues freely.</p><p>Our event was a place for learning and teaching, listening and speaking, and most importantly, vibesing and snacking. Alongside, a carefully selected cuisine of Afro-Caribbean delights, an array of impressive speakers including anti-police brutality icon Marcia Rigg, the prolific writer and researcher Adam Elliot-Cooper, genderqueer academic, Grime MC/ Rapper and Poet Melz, activist Amal Bider as well as, the smiling melaninated faces of our team; Kennedy Walker, Ayeisha Thomas-Smith and Zahra Dalilah.</p><p>Hearing the story of Marcia Rigg, whose brother died in police custody and her efforts to get justice where there is apparently none, led her to state, “there is no justice, there is just us,”. Her cynicism about policing in the United Kingdom was matched by Adam Elliot Cooper, who highlighted the housing crisis as an essentially “racist” phenomenon and noted how council estates remain overwhelmingly necessary for minority households but are disregarded and marginalised to the point where catastrophes like Grenfell become an inevitability.</p><p>Amal Bider, an activist and campaigner gave a local perspective. She spoke on her local Kensington community organising after the Grenfell Tower disaster, which became necessary due to the local councils’ failure to respond immediately. She noted how the anarchy caused by local and national government’s failed response was instrumental in coalescing different faith and community groups to organise and manage people’s welfare.</p><p>KIN seeks to cultivate spaces, which amplify a broad range of political expression. At the event, the award-winning poet and author Dorothea Smartt gave a stunning performance – stating that for the Windrush generation, they were “a generation dreaming of a world to change.”</p><p>Beautiful poems by Brother Portrait were captivating and touched on the precious themes of origins, of travels and journeys and of race and resistance. A hilarious 90s themed drag performance from Zayn Phallic and the musical waviness of Mica Cola from ResisDanceLdn brought a party-like, jovial atmosphere to the whole night. The night was rounded off with the spiritually uplifting vibes of the Nawi Collective, a black woman’s vocal group, who invited a willing (sometimes unwilling) audience to dance and sing along to apartheid-era resistance songs. Our aim for the night was simply to take a step towards building a community but by the end, it felt like a family reunion.</p>"
